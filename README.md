# My github Jekyll page.  Minimal Mistakes theme

This is the code for my web page at [Robert Toomey Github Webpage](http://retoomey.github.io)

If you want to set up a static webpage on github using Jekyll, it's easier to start from a theme and then edit with your favorite editor.  I grabbed a basic theme setup from [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).  If you clone it as a start you can just edit files and github will run ruby for you to generate static pages from those files. 

Writing pages in markup instead of html/javascript always feels strange to me, like I'm working on a college paper or something and not programming.  But I guess that's the point, right?
