My name is Robert Toomey, and I'm currently a researcher/software architect at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma. I'm usually working on proprietary code so I occasionally do a burst of code on github when I get a chance.  This code is usually something I did for class, or a tool I made at home that I end up using at work, etc.  Maybe others can find some of it useful.

I'll probably get around to filling this out fully at some point.  You can browse other pages I've done over time to gather more info if you want:
