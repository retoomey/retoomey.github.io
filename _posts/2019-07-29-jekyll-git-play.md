# Jekyll

More playing with Jekyll and GIT command line commands.  I mostly use SVN at work, and when I use GIT it is usually within Eclipse which automates it all.  This is great, but it encourages massive laziness. So a couple of commits and pushes on the command line should grease my brain a bit.  I have always actually preferred GIT, the main reason being that a check out is a full independent clone.  The downside to a clone is checkout size/speed for a large project, because you get everything.  The upside of this is that it is easy to fix/recreate a repo because, well you have everything.
